# Core Structures and Utilities

- [structures/](mdc:bot/src/structures): Contains core data structures, classes, and types used throughout the bot. Examples include command definitions, music player logic, game logic, and integrations with external APIs.
- [utils/](mdc:bot/src/utils): Contains utility functions and helpers for common tasks such as string manipulation, API requests, event handling, and game utilities.
