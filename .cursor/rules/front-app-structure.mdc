# Frontend App Structure: [front/app/](mdc:front/app)

The [front/app/](mdc:front/app) directory contains the main frontend logic for the web application. Key subdirectories include:

- [components/](mdc:front/app/components): Reusable UI components, organized by feature (e.g., music-player, nav-bar, etc.).
- [routes/](mdc:front/app/routes): Application routes, including authenticated routes in [_authed/](mdc:front/app/routes/_authed).
- [lib/](mdc:front/app/lib): Shared libraries and helpers for the frontend.
- [styles/](mdc:front/app/styles): CSS and styling resources.
- [utils/](mdc:front/app/utils): Utility functions for the frontend.
- [hono/](mdc:front/app/hono): Hono framework integrations (if used).

The main entry point for the frontend is typically [client.tsx](mdc:front/app/client.tsx) or [router.tsx](mdc:front/app/router.tsx).
