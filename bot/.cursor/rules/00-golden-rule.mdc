# The Golden Rule: The Orchestrator

This is the most important rule. Before performing any task, you MUST consult this file's routing table to identify the specific, mandatory rule files required for your task. Failure to consult the correct combination of rules will result in flawed output.

## Task-to-Rule Routing Table

**If the task is to...**

*   **Create a new Discord slash command:**
    *   Consult `01-project-architecture-overview.mdc` for context.
    *   Consult `05-boilerplate-command.mdc` for the mandatory template and process.
    *   Consult `10-coding-style-and-conventions.mdc` for general style.

*   **Create a new Discord context menu:**
    *   Consult `01-project-architecture-overview.mdc` for context.
    *   Consult `06-boilerplate-context-menu.mdc` for the mandatory template.
    *   Consult `10-coding-style-and-conventions.mdc` for general style.

*   **Create a new Discord event handler:**
    *   Consult `01-project-architecture-overview.mdc` for context.
    *   Consult `07-boilerplate-event-handler.mdc` for the mandatory template.
    *   Consult `10-coding-style-and-conventions.mdc` for general style.

*   **Add or modify an API endpoint:**
    *   Consult `04-api-development-hono.mdc`.
    *   If database interaction is needed, also consult `03-database-and-schema-rules.mdc`.

*   **Modify the database schema:**
    *   Consult `03-database-and-schema-rules.mdc`. This is the ONLY relevant file.

*   **Write a database query:**
    *   Consult `03-database-and-schema-rules.mdc`.

*   **Create a new AI-powered ChatBot personality:**
    *   Consult `08-ai-feature-development.mdc`.

*   **Create a new Tool for an AI agent:**
    *   Consult `08-ai-feature-development.mdc`.

*   **Work with Discord message components (Buttons, Select Menus):**
    *   Consult `09-discord-component-usage.mdc`.

*   **Refactor existing code for any reason:**
    *   First, identify the primary domain of the code (e.g., Command, API, Database).
    *   Then, consult the relevant rule file(s) from this table as if you were creating it from scratch. Adherence to the rules during refactoring is mandatory.
